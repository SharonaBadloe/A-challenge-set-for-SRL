# A-challenge-set-for-SRL

For this report, I created a challenge dataset to test and compare the
linguistics capabilities of two neural SRL systems from the AllenNLP
institute. The challenge dataset has been created with the use of
CheckList (https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.442/). The further
research section contains suggestions of how to use the contents of this
report for a medical domain adaptation task involving SRL.
